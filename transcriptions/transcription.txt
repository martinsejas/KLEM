 it's 4 am in the big test is in 8 hours followed by a piano recital you've been studying and playing for days but you still don't feel ready for either so what can you do well you can drink another cup of coffee and spend the next few hours training and practising but believe it or not you might be better off closing the books putting away the music and going to
 sleep occupies nearly a third of our lives but many of us give surprisingly little attention in care
 listening is often the result of a major misunderstanding sleep isn't a lost time or just the way to rest when all our important work
 instead it's a critical function during which balances and regulates its vital systems affecting respiration and regulating everything from circulation to growth and immune response that's great but you can worry about all those things after this test right well not so fast it turns out that sleep is also crucial for your brain with a fifth of your body circulatory Blood being channel to as you drift off and what goes on in your brain while you sleep is an intensely active period of restructuring that's crucial for our memory works at first glance our ability to remember things doesn't seem very impressive at all 19th century psychologist Hermann ebbinghaus demonstrated that we normally forget 40% of new material within the First 20 Minutes of phenomenon known as the forgetting
 this loss can be prevented through memory consolidation the process by which information is moved from are fleeting a short-term memory to are more durable long-term
 disk consolidation occurs with the help of a major part of the brain known as the hippocampus
 it's role in long-term memory formation was demonstrated in the 1950s by Brenda Milner in her research with a patient known as h
 after having his hippocampus removed H&M ability to form new short-term memories was damaged but he was able to learn a physical tasks the reputation due to the removal of hippocampus H&M ability to form long-term memories was also damaged what this case revealed on other things was that the hippocampus was specifically involved in the consolidation of long-term declarative memory such as the facts and Concepts you need to remember for that test rather than procedural memory such as the finger movements you need to master for that recital milner's findings along with work by Erik candle in the 90s have given us our current model of how this consolidation process works sensory data is initially transcribed and temporarily recorded in the Neurons as short-term memory from there a travel to the hippocampus which strengthens and enhances the Neurons in that cortical area thanks to the phenomenon of neural plasticity of synaptic bloods are formed allowing new connections between neurones and strengthening the neural network where the information will be returned as long-term memory so why do we remember some things and not others well there are few ways to influence the extent and effectiveness of memory retention for example memories that are formed in times of heightened feeling or even stress will be better recorder due to the hippocampus is linked with emotion but one of the major factors contributing to memory consolidation is you getting a good night sleep sleep is composed of four stages the deepest of which are known as slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement by machines monitoring people during these stages of shown electrical impulses moving between the brainstem hippocampus thalamus and Cortex which serve as relay stations of memory formation in the different stages is of sleep I've been shown to help consolidate different types of memories during the non-rem slow wave sleep the clarity of memory is encoded into a temporary store in the anterior part of the hippocampus continuing dialogue between the Cortex and hippocampus it is then repeated the reactivated driving its gradual redistribution to long-term storage in the Cortex REM sleep on the other hand with its similarity to wake and brain activity is associated with the consolidation of procedural memory so based on the studies going to sleep 3 hours after memorising your formulas and one hour after practising your scales would be the most
 so hopefully you can see now that skimping on sleep not only harms your long-term health but actually makes it less likely that you retain all that knowledge and practise from the previous night all of it just goes to a firm the wisdom of the phrase sleep on it when you think about all the internal restructuring and forming of new Connections that occurs while you slumber you can even say that proper sleep will have you waking up every morning with a new and improved brain ready to face the challenges ahead
