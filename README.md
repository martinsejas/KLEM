We add a model first to detect if there's human speech or not in the given audio file. This model is based on Random Forest. 

The data for training and inference are preproccessed to a Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients representation.

For now we trained the model on our voice recordings. The model performs well on audio containing human speech but not as good on the audio without human speech. 

To improve the accuracy of the model we need a larger and more various training audio sets.
